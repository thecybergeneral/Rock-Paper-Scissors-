# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Game.


If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
In this version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player).
When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again
If there is a winner, it prints the winner, and the program ends. 
If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), restart the game.
